# Automate R3 Corda Workflows with n8n: Introducing Our New Community Node

We're excited to announce the release of our latest n8n community node: **n8n-nodes-r3-corda**. Built by the team at Velocity BPA, this node brings enterprise blockchain automation to your fingertips.

## The Challenge with Corda Integration

R3 Corda is a powerful distributed ledger platform used by enterprises worldwide for secure transaction processing. However, integrating Corda operations into broader business workflows has traditionally required significant custom development. Teams often struggle to connect Corda vault queries, flow executions, and token management with their existing tools and processes.

That's where automation comes in.

## Meet n8n-nodes-r3-corda

Our new community node bridges the gap between R3 Corda and the n8n automation ecosystem. Now you can seamlessly integrate Corda operations into your automated workflows without writing complex integration code.

**Key Features:**

- **Vault Queries**: Retrieve and filter states from your Corda vault directly within n8n workflows
- **Flow Execution**: Trigger and monitor Corda flows as part of automated processes
- **Token Management**: Handle token operations with ease, enabling sophisticated financial workflows
- **No-Code Interface**: Configure Corda operations using n8n's intuitive visual interface

## Real-World Use Cases

Imagine automatically querying your Corda vault when a new invoice arrives via email, executing payment flows based on approval workflows, or synchronizing token balances with your accounting system. With n8n-nodes-r3-corda, these complex integrations become drag-and-drop simple.

## Getting Started

Installing the node is straightforward. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-r3-corda


Restart n8n, and the R3 Corda node will appear in your node palette, ready to configure.
